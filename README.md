# moodle_filter_inlinequestion
Filter for Moodle to display question in any content

Credit goes to Filip Fecko, my student at Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra, Slovakia

This is the early version of the moodle_filter_inlinequestion. It's working but it's not ideal. It only works for a teacher or for user with the abbility to display preview of a question (I need to resolve this)
